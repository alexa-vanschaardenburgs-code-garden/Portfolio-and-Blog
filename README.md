# ðŸŒ¿ My Personal Portfolio

Welcome! This is the space Iâ€™ve built to share a bit more about who I am â€” as a developer, a problem solver, and a curious human always learning.

Designed with creativity and scalability in mind, my portfolio is a place where folks can explore my work, read about the projects I care most about, and easily get in touch. It's also been a great playground for me to grow my front-end skills and experiment with responsive design.
